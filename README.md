My personal project 


1. AKS Ingress on localhost Mac

To make it work we need to add ip to host mapping on etc/hosts file
When we are working on minikube we have to open tunnel on separate terminal that will be working in background

2. AKS Node Port on localhost Mac

Step 1: Install Qemu

Install the Qemu emulator using the following command.

brew install qemu
Step 2: Setup Qemu socket_vvmnet

For minikube service URLs to work, you need to start the socket_vmnet service

brew install socket_vmnet
brew tap homebrew/services
HOMEBREW=$(which brew) && sudo ${HOMEBREW} services start socket_vmnet
Step 3: Install minikube

brew install minikube
Step 4: Start Minikube with the Qemu driver and socket_vmnet

minikube start --driver qemu --network socket_vmnet

To validate the networking, get the service URL using the following command. It will give you the node IP with NodePort in URL format.

minikube service <service name with node port> --url

If you donâ€™t have socket_vmnet running with Qemu and if you try to access Minikube service URLs, you will get the error.
